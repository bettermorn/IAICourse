        "- Typical sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) models are encoder-decoder models, which usually consists of two parts, the encoder and decoder, respectively. These two parts can be implemented with recurrent neural network (RNN) or transformer, primarily to deal with input/output sequences of dynamic length.\n",
        "- **Encoder** encodes a sequence of inputs, such as text, video or audio, into a single vector, which can be viewed as the abstractive representation of the inputs, containing information of the whole sequence.\n",
        "- **Decoder** decodes the vector output of encoder one step at a time, until the final output sequence is complete. Every decoding step is affected by previous step(s). Generally, one would add \"< BOS >\" at the begining of the sequence to indicate start of decoding, and \"< EOS >\" at the end to indicate end of decoding.\n",
